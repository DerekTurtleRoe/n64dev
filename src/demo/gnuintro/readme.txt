This is a rip-off of CZN's intro releases, but with an important
reason: It uses the GNU tools, not the snsys stuff, so it will compile
on pretty much any platform. It's also marginally more legal. It's
also simpler that their stuff (although not by much).

All the end result does is display a CZN logo on the screen.

However, it does clear up some problems people may be having getting
the GNU utils working, and includes some directions on how to get
those tools to do what you want them to.

It uses my 'nifty' tool, which is pretty much the same as runcart:
   It updates the checksum
   It updates the image name
   It updates the load address

It represents quite a lot of work from me - no-one told me anything
about how to get the GNU stuff to work right, and I don't want anyone
else to go through the same crap that I did.
