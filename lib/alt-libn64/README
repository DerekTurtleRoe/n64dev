Features:
- structures for VI, AI, SI, and MI regs
- fairly simple video and audio configuration
- pixel-level writing to the screen, full-screen fill
- text writing
- raw audio buffer writing
- controller reading
- structure for controller state info
- exception handler, with AI and VI interrupt callback registration
- link script
- demo, containing working Makefile
