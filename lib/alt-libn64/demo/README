alt-libn64 demo

Here's a basic demo of the alt-libn64 library. Also included are
interrupt-driver audio and video schedulers. The audio isn't too great, stutters
a bit when starting. The video is quite usable, and will support either double
or triple buffering.

It is not a terribly interesting demo, it displays information about the
controllers and a scrollable waveform. A sine save is continuously rendered and
played, adjust its volume and balance with the analog stick of the first
controller. Timing information is also displayed. Oh, and the screen turns red
when start is pressed on the first controller.

Paths may need to be adjusted, see the top of the Makefile.
