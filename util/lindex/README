1. LINDEX - DEXDRIVE UTILITIES FOR LINUX

  I got a DexDrive because I wanted to backup my PlayStation memory cards and
  reuse them rather than forking out for some new ones.  Problem was, one of
  them was a bit iffy and kept turning up errors under the Windows version of
  the DexDrive software.  I couldn't find any utilities to perform a test on
  the card so I wrote my own.  

  Once I got a solid driver working, I started to think about writing some 
  more utilities to read and write the same saved game files as the Windows
  software -- a worthy cause since InterAct don't supply any non-Windows
  drivers for the DexDrive.  At this point I found out about the Dexux project
  so I stopped working on LinDex, safe in the knowledge that someone else was
  working on similar software.

2. FEEDBACK

  LinDex was written entirely by me so any feedback, bug reports and so on can
  be directed via email to Dan <dan@phoo.org> or by taking a look at the LinDex
  web pages <http://www.phoo.org>.
