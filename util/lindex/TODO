1. TODO

  o  Implement load and save functions for raw and GME formatted saved game
     files.
  
  o  Sort out the command-line interface which isn't actually there.

  o  Work out how to print KANJI strings so that the block test works.

  o  Move to a make based build system and generally sort out my C programming
     style so that compiling LinDex isn't such a cross-your-fingers event.
