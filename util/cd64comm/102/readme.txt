I shouldn't have ported n64comm .95 and just done this version (cd64comm
1.02) .. Don't ask what's wrong with me :)  Anyways here it is. Still needs
some testing, so if it works, please email me and let me know. I need a cd64
and a procomm card to test, thus, someone else is going to have to do it
for me.  This program should cause no harm to you or your cd64 or your
computer, but remember, this program is GPL; use at your own risk.
