This code is _experimental_ .. Meaning that I havn't tried it because I do 
not own a cd64.  The code can NOT in any way ruin your computer by doing
anything that it shouldn't.  The code is direct from the n64comm for DOS, I
changed only enough to have it working on linux.. I added nothing.  Any
questions/bug reports/flames/etc email chuckjr@sundial.net -- Thank you.
