<title>Starting N64 Coding</title>
<h1>Starting N64 Coding</h1>

The folowing letter was from JL_Picard and posted to the Coders Heaven Message Board at <a href="http://www.dextrose.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi">Dextrose</a>.

It's true that there isn't very much basic info on how to get started,
perhaps because it is assumed that you are a somewhat experienced coder
already with other systems. The N64 is NOT the system for you if you
can't code simple PC graphics or etc yet...

<p>
If you have experience coding and have knowledge about system
architectures and compilers, and algorithms, etc., then you will
already have a head start with what you need for N64 coding. N64 coding
is a little different than just hitting CTRL-F9 in your DOS IDE.
There's no debugger, theres no automatic code cleaner or anything else.
You must learn a lot of things by hand, and that is why its easier to
start off with the PC first. Even better, linux, because it forces you
to be more technical along the way.  <p>

Regarding backup units, get a <a href="http://www.bung.com.hk/press.htm">
v64 junior</a>. It's the best
for coding, nothing else even comes close.

<p>
Regarding what you / other people / etc will need for basic N64
development: (assuming you're familiar with coding and terminology etc
already)

<p>
- If you have Linux and GCC that will compile for MIPS, great...its
free and thats one less thing that will get you in trouble
...there's another option (for DOS) but it's not recommended because
it's much more difficult to get.

<p>
You can use GCC -> MIPS to compile and link your code. There are also
several freeware utilities you will need to convert the binary so it
will work on an N64 and backup unit, like CRC utils and etc. These are
all found on <a href="http://www.dextrose.com/dx_section_1.htm">www.dextrose.com in the coding section</a>.

<p>
If you are planning on coding in MIPS assembly language, you'll need to
have a command of the language, you can read up on it at www.mips.com
in their labyrinth of a website, in their MIPS docs.  (The N64
processor is a customized r4000 CPU).

<p>
If you're planning on using C, you have a few options. 

<p>
1) Get MN64C, Colin's compiler. This has the advantage of being free.
Keep in mind that all N64 development usually borders on the fringe of
being illegal

<p>
2) You can search for the infamous "N64 Devkit". It is NOT offered
anywhere public as it is illegal to have unless you're a licensed
developer, which I think it's safe to say that you're not The devkit is
much more robust than mn64c / etc, simply because it is made by
Nintendo / SGI and it is more comprehensive. MN64C is limited, for
example you will not be able to use the RCP / RSP (the coprocessor that
handles all 3D and hardware sprites). This does not mean it won't be
able to in a future version...

<p>
Perhaps you may find the devkit offered somewhere on IRC, or maybe you can find it on a web search engine (doubtful).
Please do not ask me where to get it. If you truly want it, you'll find it eventually.
The only thing I can suggest apart from this is that continually check <a href="http://www.dextrose.com/">www.dextrose.com</a>, it has a lot of resources for
coders. 
There is a lot of sample code for you to download, take a look at Locke^'s Ultra demo if you want to do 3D. it's pretty
advanced for beginners but it will give you an idea of what you're up against when you try to use the RCP  (and you
need the devkit to compile it)

<p>
There's also a VERY simple app on <a href="http://www.blackbag.org">
www.blackbag.org</a> that uses the N64's
color frame buffer (CFB). This is a simple way to draw GFX which is
easy to program.

<p>
Most advanced things that use the N64 hardware (Hardware 3D, controller
input, controller pak, rumble pak, etc) all require the devkit
however.

<p> There is also a support channel on EFNET IRC in which people are
always welcome to come in and ask questions, after all thats what its
there for.

<p>
Above all, you need time to experiment.  Don't expect to sit down one
day and begin to program the n64, it has taken me several MONTHS to get
where I am, and I'm STILL learning. Impatience is the worst attribute
you can have.

<p>
Good luck...,<br>
