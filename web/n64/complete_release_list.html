All release list updates on hold indefinitely.  They weren't necessarily the most complete lists anyway.  I plan on having a boot/save list of at least USA games up soon, but it's nothing you
couldn't already gather from my <a href="usa_boot_save_faq.html">FAQ</a>.  I am working (and have been for some time now) a complete
database of N64 games and their corresponding info including Box art, screen shots, review and media links, descriptions, cracks, trainers, patches etc.  It's coming along rather well, but
slow, and I don't want to put it online until it's as complete as can be, which could be well
after the last N64 game is ever released.
